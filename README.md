# openshift_hard_way

Welcome to my adventure learning openshift. 

And before you are asking why I am doing this way, remember, I am learning and doing it the hard way!


## Scenario

I am trying to replicate the same scenario as I encountered in the companies I worked for. Usually they are:



* Offline environment (cluster does not have access to the internet).
* Different machines for each service (company wild load balance, DNS, DHCP managed by different servers)
* Network segregation (multiple networks for each part of the cluster)


## Testing Environment

To see how my lab is configured and how it looks. Please check my [dev.to](dev.to) blog post.
